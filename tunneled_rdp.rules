# Snort Rules: The main indicator of tunneled RDP occurs when the RDP handshake
# has a designated low source port generally used for another protocol. 
# Figure 5 provides two sample Snort rules that can help security teams 
# identify RDP tunneling in their network traffic by identifying designated low
# source ports generally used for other protocols.
